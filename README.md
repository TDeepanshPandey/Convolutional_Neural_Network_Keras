# Convolutional Neural Network (Python)

I have designed a convolutional neural network with one convolutional layer on a picture dataset to learn whether the specified image is a cat or dog. Then, the network is predict on an unseen image. The network has a accuracy of 77% percent and was able to classify the images properly. 

Dataset URL - *https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/deep-learning* under CNN section.
